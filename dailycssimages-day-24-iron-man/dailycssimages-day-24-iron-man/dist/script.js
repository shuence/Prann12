Mainly inspired by this drawing videotutorial for kids https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MB1S6Y_VQo (I kinda suck drawing xD). Thank you so much, Draw so cute :D.
Also a bit by a drawn in becuo.com. Didn't put the photo because Firefox warn the site is a pishing site ^_^U, I saw it in DuckDuckGo image results for "iron man + chibi". I gave me the idea about how to colour arms & legs.
